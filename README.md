Third-Party APIs Homework

User story - As an employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

The Assginment has the following - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS Functional, deployed application.

Create a GitHub repository with both a unique name and a README describing project.

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Build each timeblock and make sure it contains an input field and a save button.

When you click a timeblock's "Save" button, it stores the input text in your local storage.  This will allow the text to remain even when the application is refreshed.

When you open the app, the current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.

GIVEN that an employee adds events to a specific hour in a calendar

THEN events are saved in the timeblock for that hour
